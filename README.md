# Overr-Syncerr

This project was created to improve my Plex experienceâ€”and that of my usersâ€”by giving them just enough control to solve one of the biggest challenges: subtitles. Over time, it has expanded to include features like automatic media labeling, better translations, and, most recently, personalized audio preferences. Now, users can have their preferred language, codec, and channel count automatically selected, ensuring the best audio experience while reducing unnecessary transcoding.
While this project is designed around my setup, you're welcome to adapt it to fit your own needs!

Overr-Syncerr is a script designed to automate the management of subtitle synchronization issues across your media library. By leveraging **[Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev)** and **[Jellyseerr](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr)**'s built-in webhook and issue reporting functionality, this script allows users to specify the subtitles they need synchronized. It seamlessly integrates with your existing services such as **[Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/)**, **[Radarr](https://radarr.video/)**, and **[Bazarr](https://www.bazarr.media)**, making the entire process of subtitle synchronization more automated.
